# PAYDAY-2-Project-White-House
A Steam Depot Downloader and mod pack download script for version 197.2 of PAYDAY 2. This also backports many weapon buffs from modern PAYDAY.

This script will download update 197.2 of PAYDAY 2 and install all of the mods in this repository automatically.

It will ask for your Steam login credentials. This is needed for Depot Downloader to function. Please see here if you want to learn more: https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader

The mods repository can be found here: https://github.com/MatthewCAbel/Project-White-House-Mods
